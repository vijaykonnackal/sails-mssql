# Sails MsSql

A [Waterline](http://waterlinejs.org) adapter for working with the Microsoft SqlServer database.

This version works with Sails 1.x.  All Waterline Adapter Interfaces and methods are implemented based on
 the postgres implementation. 

This is largely a port of [sails-postgresql](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql)
